## Task

We would like you to create a single page React app that consist of two tabs.
First tab includes:
• Input field (create a post)
• List of posts with likes and comments. Likes are countable. Comments are like-able only.

Second tab includes:
• List of liked posts and/or comments.
Imagine that this small feature is part of a big project, where state management exist. In this case
you are not allowed to use Redux, Flux, Mobx or any kind of state management library. The goal is to
show skills related to the hooks, context and other React 16 features. You are also not allowed to
use storage of any kind, persisted data is not required or class-based components. Also do not use
any kind of utility library such as Lodash or similar, or HOC helpers based libs.. Feel free to pick any
kind of React components-based UI library such as Material etc.
